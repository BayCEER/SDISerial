SDISerial 
=========

An SDI-12 Serial Library for Arduino.

This library was designed around filling a niche that was lacking and allow Arduino boards to communicate freely with SDI-12 Serial peripherals.  It is largely based off of the Arduino SoftwareSerial Library, modified to support the SDI12-Serial Specifications.

I have tested the library with Arduino UNO as well as the MEGA2560, and it worked flawlessly with an assortment of [Decagon Devices Soil Moisture Sensors.](http://www.decagon.com/products/soils/)
